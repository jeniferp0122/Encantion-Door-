# Encantion-Door-
The Encation door is a high security door that utilizes multi-step authentication to verify user identity. When a user has been authenticated, the door will grant them access. The Encation door combines RFID technology with mobile device authentication. The door is designed to be resistant to both brute force attacks and common bypasses. It can recognize various users, and it may be implemented in both residential and business spaces. It has three LED lights visible to the user that indicate the status of the authentication process. 
There is also a backup system that still allows the door to be opened in case of power loss. The Encation door is able to be opened in less than 30 seconds.
